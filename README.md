ongoing development
This was my seventh project with HTML and CSS and I am happy with the result. Of course there are flaws and imperfections but it will be improved. I tried to structure the HTML better and used flex in CSS and used variables and introduced pseudo element properties. I added a small media query. I added in-page navigation links and an additional blog page.

I plan to continue exploring and learning more about this technology so there will definitely be more projects related to it soon.
